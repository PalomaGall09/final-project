        My name is Paloma Gallegos and creativity is my motivation in life. Drawing, wrinting poetry
        and Lego photography are my creative outlets. I've showcased my work in Seattle and San Diego.
        Coding is something I've been meaning learn. It's been fun and challenging. 

        I am from the small town of Corcoran, most of the time I had a notebook full of drawings and 
        stories. My main inspirations/role models are Jhonen Vazquez and Roman Dirge. Jhonny the 
        Homicidal Maniac and Lenore were and still are my favorite comics to read. Most of my stories 
        and characters are morbidly cute. Just like in my high school days you can find me doodling in 
        an old notebook. Right now I am working on several projects/comics. Skelly is a tiny skelenton
        dude of mine. He always wants to help little critters in need even if he puts himself in danger.
        There's plenty of more to come.

        Lego photography is another creative outlet of mine. How this came about is quite a funny story.
        I was renting a room in San Diego and the landlord's 11 year old son had a lot of Legos. He would 
        ask me to play with him and of course I did. Who doesn't play with Legos? Ha ha Then I bought my 
        own Hello Kitty Legos. We would battle his Ninjago dudes with my Hello Kitties. We would pose them
        and I took pictures. Then I had the idea of doing this in a outdoor setting to make it look more 
        intresting. So I did. The results were cute and brilliant. I would go to the Lego section in 
        Walmart and get inspiration just by looking at the diffrent Lego figurines. I bought myself a 
        nice camera and the rest is history.

        <a href="https://www.pancakesandbooze.com/">Pancakes and Booze</a> is a pop up artshow that goes around the country and features local artists.
        I was living in San Diego and they were coming to town. I submitted my Lego photography and got
        accepted. It was my first artshow and I was so proud of myself. I showed off my Lego pictures 
        and people loved them. So I decided to try the Seattle one. It was held at this place called El
        Corazon. It was such a great experience being in a new city, meeting people and experiencing the 
        local art scene. I loved it! Seattle is my dream city. People are so creative and the scenery 
        is stunning. I feel at home there.
